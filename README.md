# Relational Databases and PostgreSQL

## What is a relational database?

Data stored as row records in tables. Imagine a spreadsheet with column
headers describing the contents of each field, and each row is a
record.

A database can contain many tables. A table can contain many rows. A row
can contain many fields.

Records are related to those in different tables through common fields
that are present in both tables.

For example, an `Employee` table might have the following fields in each
record:

    Employee
        EmployeeID  FirstName  LastName  DepartmentID

And a `Department` table might have the following fields in each record:

    Department
        DepartmentID  DepartmentName

Notice that both `Employee` and `Department` have a `DepartmentID`
field. This common field *relates* the two tables and can be used to
*join* them together with a *query*.


Compare to NoSQL databases that work with key/value pairs or are document stores.

## PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a venerable relational database that is freely available
and world-class.

## SQL, Structured Query Language

SQL ("sequel") is the language that people use for interfacing with
relational databases.

### Create a table with CREATE TABLE

A database is made up of a number of tables. Let's create a table using
SQL in the shell. Be sure to end the command with a semicolon `;`.

(Note: SQL commands are often capitalized by convention, but can be
lowercase.)


    $ psql
    psql (10.1)
    Type "help" for help.

    dbname=> CREATE TABLE Employee (ID INT, LastName VARCHAR(20));

Use the `\dt` command to show which tables exist:

    dbname=> CREATE TABLE Employee (ID INT, LastName VARCHAR(20));
    CREATE TABLE
    dbname=> \dt
            List of relations
    Schema |   Name   | Type  | Owner 
    --------+----------+-------+-------
    public | employee | table | beej
    (1 row)

Use the `\d` command to see what columns a table has:

    dbname=> \d Employee
                            Table "public.employee"
        Column    |         Type          | Collation | Nullable | Default 
    --------------+-----------------------+-----------+----------+---------
     id           | integer               |           |          | 
     lastname     | character varying(20) |           |          | 

### Create a row with INSERT

    dbname=> INSERT INTO Employee (ID, LastName) VALUES (10, 'Tanngnjostr');
    INSERT 0 1

You can omit the column names if you're putting data in every column:

    dbname=> INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (10, 'Tanngnjostr');
    INSERT 0 1

Run some more inserts into the table:

    INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (11, 'Alice');
    INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (12, 'Bob');
    INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (13, 'Charlie');
    INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (14, 'Dave');
    INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (15, 'Eve');

### Read rows with SELECT

You can query the table with `SELECT`.

Query all the rows and columnts:

    dbname=> SELECT * FROM Employee;
     id |  lastname   
    ----+-------------
     10 | Tanngnjostr
     11 | Alice
     12 | Bob
     13 | Charlie
     14 | Dave
     15 | Eve
    (6 rows)

With SELECT, `*` means "all columns".

You can choose specific columns:

    dbname=> SELECT LastName FROM Employee;
      lastname   
    -------------
     Tanngnjostr
     Alice
     Bob
     Charlie
     Dave
     Eve
    (6 rows)

And you can search for specific rows with the `WHERE` clause:

    dbname=> SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE ID=12;
     id | lastname 
    ----+----------
     12 | Bob
    (1 row)

    dbname=> SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE ID=14 OR LastName='Bob';
     id | lastname 
    ----+----------
     12 | Bob
     14 | Dave
    (2 rows)


### Update rows with UPDATE

The `UPDATE` command can update one or many rows. Restrict which rows
are updated with a `WHERE` clause.`

    dbname=> UPDATE Employee SET LastName='Harvey' WHERE ID=10;
    UPDATE 1

    dbname=> SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE ID=10;
     id | lastname 
    ----+----------
     10 | Harvey
    (1 row)

You can update multiple columns at once:

    dbname=> UPDATE Employee SET LastName='Octothorpe', ID=99 WHERE ID=14;
    UPDATE 1


### Delete rows with DELETE

Delete from a table with the `DELETE` command. Use a `WHERE` clause to
restrict the delete.

**CAUTION!** If you don't use a `WHERE` clause, all rows will be deleted
from the table!

Delete some rows:

    dbname=> DELETE FROM Employee WHERE ID >= 15;
    DELETE 2

Delete **ALL** rows (*Danger, Will Robinson!*):

    dbname=> DELETE FROM Employee;
    DELETE 4

### Deleting entire tables with DROP

If you want to get rid of an entire table, use `DROP`.

**WARNING!** There is no going back. Table will be completely blown
away. Destroyed ...by the Empire.

    dbname=> DROP TABLE Employee;
    DROP TABLE

## ACID and CRUD

These are two common database terms.

### ACID

Short for *Atomicity*, *Consistency*, *Isolation*, *Durability*. When
people mention "ACID-compliance", they're generally talking about the
ability of the database to accurately record transactions in the case of
crash or power failure.

Atomicity: all transactions will be "all or nothing".

Consistency: all transactions will leave the database in a consistent
state with all its defined rules and constraints.

Isonlation: the results of concurrent transactions is the same as if
those transactions had been executed sequentially.

Durability: Once a transaction is committed, it will remain committed,
despite crashes, power outages, snow, and sleet.

### CRUD

Short for *Create*, *Read*, *Update*, *Delete*. Describes the four basic
functions of a data store.

In a relational database, these functions are handled by `INSERT`,
`SELECT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.

## NULL and NOT NULL

Columns in records can sometimes have no data, referred to by the
special keyword as `NULL`. Sometimes it makes sense to have NULL fields,
and sometimes it doesn't.

If you explicitly want to disallow NULL fields in your table, you can
create the fields with the `NOT NULL` constraint:

    CREATE TABLE Employee (
        ID INT NOT NULL,
        LastName VARCHAR(20));

## Keys, Primary and Foreign

Rows in a table often have one column that is called the *primary key*.
The value in this column applies to all the rest of the data in the
record. For example, an `EmployeeID` would be a great primary key,
assuming the rest of the record held employee information.

    Employee
        ID (Primary Key)  LastName  FirstName  DepartmentID

To create a table and specify the primary key, use the `NOT NULL` and
`PRIMARY KEY` constraints:

    CREATE TABLE Employee (
        ID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
        LastName VARCHAR(20),
        FirstName VARCHAR(20),
        DepartmentID INT);

You can always search quickly by primary key.

If a key refers to a primary key in another table, it is called a
*foreign key*. You are not allowed to make changes to the database that
would cause the foreign key to refer to a non-existent record.

The database uses this to maintain *referential integrity*.

Create a foreign key using the `REFERENCES` constraint. It specifies the
remote table and column the key refers to.

    CREATE TABLE Department (
        ID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
        Name VARCHAR(20));

    CREATE TABLE Employee (
        ID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
        LastName VARCHAR(20),
        FirstName VARCHAR(20),
        DepartmentID INT REFERENCES Department(ID));

In the above example, you cannot add a row to `Employee` until that
`DepartmentID` already exists in `Department`'s `ID`.

Also, you cannot delete a row from `Department` if that row's `ID` was a
`DepartmentID` in `Employee`.


## Indexes

When searching through tables, you use a `WHERE` clause to narrow things down. For speed, the columns mentioned in the `WHERE` clause should either be a primary key, or a column for which an *index* has been built.

Indexes help speed searches. In a large table, searching over an unindexed column will be *slow*.

Example of creating an index on the Employee table from the
[Keys](#keys-primary-and-foreign) section:

    dbname=> CREATE INDEX ON Employee (LastName);
    CREATE INDEX

    dbname=> \d Employee
                            Table "public.employee"
        Column    |         Type          | Collation | Nullable | Default 
    --------------+-----------------------+-----------+----------+---------
     id           | integer               |           | not null | 
     lastname     | character varying(20) |           |          | 
     firstname    | character varying(20) |           |          | 
     departmentid | integer               |           |          | 
    Indexes:
        "employee_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
        "employee_lastname_idx" btree (lastname)
    Foreign-key constraints:
        "employee_departmentid_fkey" FOREIGN KEY (departmentid) REFERENCES department(id)

* [PostgreSQL CREATE INDEX documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createindex.html)


## Transactions

In PostgreSQL, you can bundle a series of statements into a
*transaction*. The transaction is executed *atomically*, which means
either the entire transaction occurs, or none of the transaction occurs.
There will never be a case where a transaction partially occurs.

Create a transaction by starting with a `BEGIN` statement, followed by
all the statements that are to be within the transaction.

To execute the transaction ("Let's do it!"), end with a `COMMIT`
statement.

To abort the transaction and do nothing ("On second thought,
nevermind!") end with a `ROLLBACK` statement. *This makes it like
nothing within the transaction ever happened.*

Usually transactions happen within a program that checks for sanity and
either commits or rolls back.

Pseudocode making DB calls that check if a rollback is necessary:

    db("BEGIN"); // Begin transaction

    db("UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100.00
        WHERE name = 'Alice'");

    balance = db("SELECT balance WHERE name = 'Alice'");

    // Don't let the balance go below zero:
    if (balance < 0) {
        db("ROLLBACK"); // Never mind!! Roll it all back.
    } else {
        db("COMMIT"); // Plenty of cash
    }
    
In the above example, the `UPDATE` and `SELECT` must happen at the same
time (*atomically*) or else another process could sneak in between and
withdraw too much money. Because it needs to be atomic, it's wrapped in
a transaction.

If you just enter a single SQL statement that is not inside a `BEGIN`
transaction block, it gets automatically wrapped in a `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`
block. It is a mini transaction that is `COMMIT`ted immediately.

Not all SQL databases support transactions, but most do.


## Normalization and Normal Forms

*Normalization* is the process of designing or refactoring your tables
for maximum consistency and minimum redundancy.

With NoSQL databases, we're used to *denormalized* data that is stored
with speed in mind, and not so much consistency (sometimes NoSQL databases talk about *eventual consistency*).

Non-normalized tables are considered an anti-pattern in relational databases.

## Assignment: Install PostgreSQL

**IMPORTANT!** These instructions assume you haven't already installed
PostgreSQL. If you have already installed it, skip this section or
Google for how to upgrade your installation.

### Mac with Homebrew

1. Open a terminal
2. Install PostgreSQL: `brew install postgresql`
3. Start the database process
    * If you want to start it every time you log in, run:

          brew services start postgresql

    * If you want to just start it one time right now, run:

          pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start

4. Create a database named the same as your username: `createdb $(whoami)`
    * Optionally you can call it anything you want, but the shell
      defaults to looking for a database named the same as your user.

   This database will contain tables.

Then start a shell by running `psql` and see if it works. You should see
this prompt:

    $ psql
    psql (10.1)
    Type "help" for help.

    dbname=> 

(Use `psql databasename` if you created the database under something
other than your username.)

Use `\l` to get a list of databases.

You can enter `\q` to exit the shell.


### Arch Linux

Arch requires a bit more hands-on, but not much more. Check this out if
you want to see a different Unix-y install procedure (or if you run
Arch).

  Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PostgreSQL)


## Assignment: Create a Table and Use It

Launch the shell on your database, and create a table.

    CREATE TABLE Employee (ID INT, FirstName VARCHAR(20), LastName VARCHAR(20));

Insert some records:

    INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (1, 'Alpha', 'Alphason');
    INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (2, 'Bravo', 'Bravoson');
    INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (3, 'Charlie', 'Charleson');
    INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (4, 'Delta', 'Deltason');
    INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (5, 'Echo', 'Ecoson');

Select all records:

    SELECT * FROM Employee;

Select Employee #3's record:

    SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE ID=3;

Delete Employee #3's record:

    DELETE FROM Employee WHERE ID=3;
 
Use `SELECT` to verify the record is deleted.

Update Employee #2's name to be "Foxtrot Foxtrotson":

    UPDATE Employee SET FirstName='Foxtrot', LastName='Foxtrotson' WHERE ID=2;

Use `SELECT` to verify the update.
